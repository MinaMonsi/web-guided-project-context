// Note: unlike Redux, we can have multiple sources of truth. Instead of one store, we have one or more contexts. Generally each context is for a specific group of components and/or with a specific functionality in mind (e.g., auth, user profile, blog, etc) but it's totally up to your own design.

// When consuming a context with useContext, remember to specify which context you want to consume! (There won't always be just one)
